Dev Notes:


Music Mixer Feature Breakdown
* User drags the animal icon from the icon dock to the forest, drops it in one of the six spots.
* Drop the icon in a spot and the icon starts to play its specific sound
* Animation will take place of the creature making the sound
* Docked icons will not make sound and will not be animated
* Reset button needs to be added
* If a new icon is dropped on top of an icon that is playing music they swap.


Needed to implement these features
* Add draggable attribute to the icons
* Js handles the drag functionality, set id of icon to dragged -> use set and get methods on drag event
* Reparent on a drop -> retrieve the id of the icon we are dragging and then reparent it to the spot where it was dropped (the active drop zones)
* On drop we have to set the sound and animation to be active
* Each icon will have an index


Things we have to learn to create this:
* How to change an svg state to become animated. 
* How to swap out an icon if another icon is put on that drop zone.
